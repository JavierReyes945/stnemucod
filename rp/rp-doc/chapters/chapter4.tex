\chapter{Software Application} \label{software-application}

The current application is in WIP (Work In Progress) state, as there are technical challenges to
overcome. Esentially, the application is coded in C (with an option created in C++ for testing), and
built in the Xilinx SDK via the cross-compilers that Xilinx provide for the ARM7 architecture.
